Design a dynamic IP address allocation service with the following requirements in mind: 

a. The service must expose two endpoints:

One for IP address allocation with 

interface AllocationService { 
  String allocate(String macAddress); 
}

Second for the heartbeat message to renew the allocation 

interface HeartbeatService { 
  Boolean refresh(String macAddress, String allocatedIPAddr);
} 

b. IP address range must be configurable 
c. Expiry time must be configurable 
d. Each client must be allocated a unique IP address 
e. IPs must be “leased”, rather permanently allocated, which means the allocation should expire after certain time. This implies that the client must regularly hit the heartbeat endpoint to update its presence 
f. How well will the service scale?
